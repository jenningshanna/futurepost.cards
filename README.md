##This is a site where people can send postcards to their future selves.

*This site is currently down due to processing issues and is in need of renovations*
	
####Why would anyone want this?

It's a nostalgia machine. Popular services have already starting showing you what you posted a year ago like Facebook. Why not get a artifact that you can put on your fridge or hide away in a journal for future generations to find?

####How does it work?

You submit your info, write a note to your future self and upload an image for the front of the postcard. Then you select wether you want to receive it in 3 months, 6 months, or a year. 

####What is it?

It's a service that sends you or someone you love a postcard in the future. It's unique in the fact that it doesn't happen

####What does it need to get up and running you ask?

#####This time machine needs a new brain: right now it works through Wufoo and then me creating the postcards by hand and printing them! 

It needs:
	- a database of it's own
	- a tie in to a payment processing system
	- a tie in with a postcard printing system
